# Claude Rules - ML Learning Project

## Project Goal
Learn neural networks by building an MNIST digit classifier from scratch.

## Guidelines for Claude

### Teaching Style
- **Code-focused**: Explain concepts through well-commented code
- **Incremental**: Build up complexity step by step
- **Runnable**: Each file should be independently executable

### When Writing Code
- Add comments explaining the "why" not just the "what"
- Show the math alongside the code where helpful
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `hidden_output` not `h`)
- Print intermediate shapes to help debug tensor dimensions

### Progression
1. NumPy basics → 2. From-scratch NN → 3. PyTorch equivalent

### Key Concepts to Emphasize
- Forward propagation: how data flows through layers
- Backpropagation: how gradients flow backward
- Gradient descent: how weights get updated
- Why activation functions matter
